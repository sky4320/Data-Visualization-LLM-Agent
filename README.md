# Data-Visualization-LLM-Agent

## üëÅÔ∏è Overview

This project develops an **LLM-driven conversational agent** for business data. It translates natural language into optimized SQL, executes queries, and visualizes the results. Our goal is to make data exploration accessible to non-technical users and reduce the data querying effort for analysts by up to 60-70%.

-----

## üöÄ Key Features

  * **Natural Language to SQL:** An LLM-powered translator generates optimized SQL statements from plain English queries.
  * **Dynamic Visualizations:** Query results are returned as dynamic charts (bar, pie, line graphs) or tables.
  * **Multi-Turn Conversations:** The agent supports follow-up questions and context retention using short-term and long-term memory.
  * **Ambiguity Handling:** Prompts users for clarification on vague or incomplete queries.
  * **Safe Execution:** A backend SQL engine with robust logic to sanitize inputs and handle errors gracefully.
  * **Optional Python Code Generation:** The system can generate code snippets for advanced analysis, time permitting.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Getting Started for Developers

### 1\. Cloning the Repository

To get a local copy of this project, open your terminal and run the following command. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sky4320/Data-Visualization-LLM-Agent/
```

Then, navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd Data-Visualization-LLM-Agent
```

### 2\. Switching to the Development Branch (`dev`)

All active development happens on the `develop` branch. After cloning, you need to switch to it from the default `main` branch.

```bash
git checkout develop
```

### 3\. Standard Workflow

Always pull the latest changes before you start working to avoid conflicts.

```bash
git pull origin develop
```

For every new feature, bug fix, or task, create a new branch from `develop`. This keeps our development branch clean and helps with code reviews.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name develop
```

Once you‚Äôve made your changes, stage and commit them.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: [Your descriptive commit message]"
```

Finally, push your branch to the remote repository. The first time, use the `-u` flag.

```bash
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
```

After your work is complete, create a Pull Request on GitHub to merge your feature branch into the **`develop`** branch.
